Task1:

I used Prim's algorithm to figure out the number of conex components. All the
nodes are introduced in the heap with cost INT_MAX. The root is introduced with
cost 0. When a node's cost is changed, the node is "visited". This is done until
all the nodes have been visited.

Task2:

I used Dijkstra's algorithm to find out the shortest path from "Insula" to
"Corabie". The priority is not distance, is some kind of "score" which
represents the ratio between the distance and the node's "depth". It is just
a classic Dijkstra.
